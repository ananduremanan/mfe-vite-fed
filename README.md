# Micro Front End Application Build with Vite-React and Vite-Federation

## Introduction

Microfrontends is a front-end web development pattern in which a single application may be built from disparate builds. It is analogous to a microservices approach but for client-side single-page applications written in JavaScript. It is a solution to de-composition and routing for multiple front-end applications[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microfrontend).

## Installation

Clone this repo and run `npm i` to install the dependencies, then run `npm run build` and `npm run serve` to start the application.
